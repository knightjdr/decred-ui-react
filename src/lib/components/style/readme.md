All of the components in this library have custom class names that begin with
'decred-ui'. Component-specific styling will be named after the component,
for example 'decred-ui-round-button' for the RoundButton component. Element-specific
styles are applied through a class with the element name, such as
'decred-ui-button' for buttons. Finally, theme-specific styles are applied using
a class name that references the element and the theme. For the whiteOnBlue
theme applied to a button this would result in a class name of
'decred-ui-button-whiteOnBlue'. If you would like to further customize the styling
beyond what has been exposed via props, you can use these class names to do so.
